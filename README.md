Session management is a crucial aspect of web application development, as it ensures that user data and preferences are stored securely and accurately. In this article, we will explore how to implement session management in Node.js applications.

What is session management?
Session management is the process of managing user sessions within a web application. A session is a period of time in which a user interacts with an application, typically starting when the user logs in and ending when they log out. Session management ensures that user data, preferences, and session-related information are securely stored and managed.

Implementing session management in Node.js applications
To implement session management in Node.js applications, you need to use a session management middleware. A middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server, processing requests and responses.
